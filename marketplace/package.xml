<package type="addon" name="platform-semantic-entities" version="5.4.0-SNAPSHOT">
  <title>Semantic Entities</title>
  <description>Extract and analyze the text content of Nuxeo documents by using
    an external Apache Stanbol server and and the knowledge base DBpedia to link
    documents to summary hubs for real life entities such as persons, places and
    organizations.

    This addon can be seen as a way to automatically annotate documents with
    semantically disambiguated tags.

    This addon will put a high write concurrency pressure on the database server.
    The test H2 database is NOT supported. To use this with a PostgreSQL server
    please apply the workaround in the comment of:
    https://jira.nuxeo.org/browse/NXP-6038

    IMPORTANT: The default configuration of this addon will automatically
    send the text content of all the newly created or modified documents
    to a demo Apache Stanbol server hosted by Nuxeo. You should not use
    the default configuration add-on on a Nuxeo repository containing
    confidential document.  For production environments you MUST configure
    your own Apache Stanbol server instance. See the marketplace page
    for further instructions.
